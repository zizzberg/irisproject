# Iris Data Set Research

## Overview

>The Iris Data Set was created by R.A Fisher and it is widely used in Machine learning to test algorithms
>It is a multivariate Data Set which by definition contains multiple variables of points for analysis. 
>It is one of the most widely used data sets in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition 
>It is used often for supervised and unsupervised classification tasks. The data set can be found widely online. 

## Research summary and links 

* It is possible to plot simple data effectively just using the matplotlib - there is an excellent article by Gilbert Tanner which outlines a variety of visualisation methods for the Iris Data Set here. [Data Visualisation in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-data-visualization-in-python-89a54c97fbed) "Examples and code")

* Running Gilbert's basic script using matplotlib results in the following image:

### Summary of Data

#### Four Flower measure features are:

* Sepal length

* Sepal width

* Petal length

* Petal width
