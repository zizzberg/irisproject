#Iris Data Set Research

## Overview

>The Iris Data Set was created by R.A Fisher and it is widely used in Machine learning to test algorithms
>It is a multivariate Data Set which by definition contains multiple variables of points for analysis. 
>It is one of the most widely used data sets in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition 
>It is used often for supervised and unsupervised classification tasks
